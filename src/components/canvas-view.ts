/**
 * A <Canvas> that runs a demo (see src/demos), filling the width it is
 * given. With `height` (dp) it is that tall; without, it fills the height its
 * box gets from classes (`flex-1`, `h-*`). Projected content is layered on top
 * of the canvas, so MasonKit content (badges, captions, controls) can sit over
 * the drawing.
 *
 * The host element is the box: MasonKit makes component hosts real views, so
 * classes set on <app-canvas-view> (`rounded-*`, `flex-1`, ...) style it like
 * any other element.
 *
 * The canvas sits in an absolutely positioned box, so like any out-of-flow
 * content it adds nothing to its container's size. In flow, its backing store
 * would be its intrinsic size (as on the web), and a flex item's automatic
 * minimum height would grow with every resize the runner makes to match it.
 *
 * The size is set on the canvas as a style, not with classes: the canvas sets
 * its own width/height as local style values, which outrank class rules.
